Caviar39 on React. Development mode.

Basic functionality is ready.
Responsive design should be rendered pretty good on full HD and HD screens
and mobiles. Tested on various notebooks on Windows in Firefox, Opera and Chrome; Android mobiles and iphone6.

Basic structre is modular. Catalog and GiftBoxes are rendered dynamicly from json files.

Used for development: webpack, basic react, popper-react.

Todo:
- implement an order page
- add sorting options for the catalog
- add a proper shopping cart
- test in older browsers and Edge
- tidy up css, maybe split the source sheets in multiple files. It is getting a bit crowded there :)

Known Issues:
- layout is a bit off on some less used screen widths
- some buttons have a wrong height
